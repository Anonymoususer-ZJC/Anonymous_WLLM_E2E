# An End-to-End Model for Logits Based Large Language Models Watermarking

This is an anonymous repository for our paper An End-to-End Model for Logits Based Large Language Models Watermarking submitted on ICLR 2025. During the paper review period, we would like to use this temporary anonymous repository for code release.

### Basic Setup

#### Setting up the environment

- python 3.9
- pytorch
- pip install -r requirements.txt

*Tips:* If you wish to utilize the EXPEdit or ITSEdit algorithm in the evaluation step, you will need to import for .pyx file, take EXPEdit as an example:

- run `python watermark/exp_edit/cython_files/setup.py build_ext --inplace`
- move the generated `.so` file into `watermark/exp_edit/cython_files/`


### Repository Structure
The project structure is as follows.
